# This file ensures the data directory is tracked by Git
# Data directory is used for:
# - Memory persistence (memory_chat.json)
# - User data storage
# - Temporary files
# - Backup files

# The actual data files are ignored by .gitignore for privacy and security
# but the directory structure is preserved for proper app initialization
